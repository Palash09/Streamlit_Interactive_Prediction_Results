# Streamlit_Interactive_Prediction_Results
This repository consists of code for visualizing the results of classification models through streamlit which helps in building an web application for such tasks.

Streamlit is used to build interactive dashboards to show the results of the machine learning based prediction results.
Here, I have used streamlit to display the results of classification of customers of bike sharing with the help of different 
machine learning algorithms.

It basically helps in combining machine learning results with user interface with ease. So here, I have tried to find out the
type of user using the services of bike share with the help of three different machine learning algorithms i.e. Decision Tree,
Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbors. 

At the end, the results are shown on a map for better visualization.
